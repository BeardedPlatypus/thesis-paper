In this sample paper, we describe the formatting requirements for
content accepted to SIGGRAPH-sponsored events. The same format can be
used for content ranging from a one-page Poster or Talk abstract, to a
full-length Technical Paper. Please review this document even if you
have submitted content to a SIGGRAPH-sponsored event in the past, as
some of the details have changed relative to previous years.
